# odin_recipes
I added my latest recipes.

It gave me a better idea of what html is and how it works. I learned how to make a list, paragaraph, description, list (ordered and unordered), how to start html document (setting document type, lang, etc.) how to insert an image, git history tracking (not fully but got the idea). 
Next goal would be to make the picture to appear at the center of the page and clickable. Change the color of the background. Bring the ingredience and steps to the center and apply animation, insert a video, curve the edges of the image, change the font.
